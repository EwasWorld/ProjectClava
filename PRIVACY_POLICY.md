  identifiable information.
- The app stores names of players that have been entered so that they can be the user can match
  players up.
- All data is stored locally on the phone and is never transmitted elsewhere.
- All stored data can be deleted by clearing the app's stored data. This can be done from the
  device's settings or by uninstalling the app.
- The app requires no permissions.
